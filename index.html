  <h2>Article on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>There were two different approaches that were spoken about in this article: "Graceful Degredation" and "Progressive Enhancement."</p>
  <p>The focus of Graceful Degradation is on the use on the most important platform or browsers. The less important browsers are "worked in" afterward,
  when problems come up by use of fixes or patches. These patches are looked at as a simpler ans easier solution than actually correcting the problem. </p>
  <p>The focus of Progressive Enhancement is to build a solid foundation of content and then fill in with lanquages, 
  such as CSS or JavaScript, to complete a plesant user experience.</p>
  <p>On a personal note, I found the article hard to read, as the author leaned way to heavily into the candy analogy. While I did not 
  see the instruction on reading another article until I got ready to write on this topic, I did seek out a<a href="https://youtu.be/zhAn2fl0_A8"> Youtube video</a> that 
  might help me understand the concept a little better. The presenter in the video presented the two concepts as if the Graceful Degradation
  was an inverted pyramid, while the Progressive Enhancement was an upright pyramid. This was a much better visual for me.  </p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflextion</h2>
    <p>I will admit that I had a hard time starting this project. In addition to the assignment seeming like a daunting task, I also hit a wall.
    I had gotten to the point in the semester where I was just very tired and needed to step back a bit. So, I didn't even start the project
    until the second week in. It's not that I didn't want to...it's that I couldn't seem to make myself step upto the plate. I didn't 
    officially start on the assignment until the second week, and I could immediately see why I should've started during the first week.</p>
    <p>The next hardest think I came up against was that when I went to do something with the pages, my brain froze. I suddenly 
    couldn't remember the difference between ids and classes and the appropriate use of either one. I would write a command an my whole site 
    would break. I just seemed to have problem after problem. THe whole project also took way longer than I anticipated.</p>
    <p>I shared my page with my older brothers to get feedback. Two of them do IT work, 1 for Verizon and 1 for large overseas companies.
    I took my project to them because I knew that 1) They have been doing work in this vein long enough that they had well trained eyes, 
    2) They would give it to me straight. They pointed out some things that I hadn't even noticed, such as my subtitle being a pixel off
    on the homepage than on the rest of the pages. They also pointed out the border bottom solid lines that I hadn't realized I had left in, 
    and the fact that the "Sample Sidebar Item" titles should be changed to something more appropriate because they weren't actually sidebars.
    They also complemented me on my conservative color palette and the fact that the page seemed well put together for a first go. They really 
    helped me tighten up the design withour being to harsh. I realize, of course, that the constructive criticism stage will not always
    be so helpful or polite. But, it was nice to experience that on my first time out of the gate.</p>
