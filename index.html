  <h2>Article on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>There were two different approaches that were spoken about in this article: "Graceful Degredation" and "Progressive Enhancement."</p>
  <p>The focus of Graceful Degradation is on the use on the most important platform or browsers. The less important browsers are "worked in" afterward,
  when problems come up by use of fixes or patches. These patches are looked at as a simpler ans easier solution than actually correcting the problem. </p>
  <p>The focus of Progressive Enhancement is to build a solid foundation of content and then fill in with lanquages, 
  such as CSS or JavaScript, to complete a plesant user experience.</p>
  <p>On a personal note, I found the article hard to read, as the author leaned way to heavily into the candy analogy. While I did not 
  see the instruction on reading another article until I got ready to write on this topic, I did seek out a<a href="https://youtu.be/zhAn2fl0_A8"> Youtube video</a> that 
  might help me understand the concept a little better. The presenter in the video presented the two concepts as if the Graceful Degradation
  was an inverted pyramid, while the Progressive Enhancement was an upright pyramid. This was a much better visual for me.  </p>
